### Abstract

This paper proposes a UML extension for the representation of quantum algorithms. 

Our proposal comprises the definition of a UML profile based on various stereotypes that can be applied to the existing UML activity diagrams in order to represent quantum circuits.

### 2 UML for Quantum Software

This section presents the usage of UML in quantum software  engineering and how it can be extended.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

#### 2.1 Usage of UML in Quantum Software

UML can help by gathering and analysing software 
requirements and incorporating them into a programme design in a technology- and methodology-independent manner.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Advantages:

1. Different perspectives
2. Design validation
3. Best practices
4. Structured Design
5. Tooling
6. Software Modernisation

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

UML needs to be adapted in order to capture all the new semantics and building blocks involved in quantum software.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

#### 2.2 UML Extensibility

UML was defined on the basis of the MOF (Meta-Object Facility).

It is possible to extend the UML by principally following three different approaches.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

1. A new instance of the MOF model

   This approach consists of creating a completely new metamodel based on MOF.

2. Derivation of a new UML metamodel

   This approach adds new metamodel elements to the existing one.

3. UML Profile

   This is a lightweight extension approach that is based on the UML built-in extension mechanism, UML Profiling.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Despite the fact that the expressiveness of UML 
profiles is limited, standardisation and conformance are better.

### 3. QUANTUM UML PROFILE

This section presents the preliminary UML profile defined in order to represent quantum programmes as activity diagrams.

- 6 stereotypes with which to add the new semantic related to quantum circuits. （right-hand side）
- An excerpt of the UML metamodel employed to
  represent UML Activity Diagrams. (left-hand side)

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

The intuitive idea behind representing quantum circuits with UML activity diagrams:

- *each algorithm* is represented with a single compound activity with the stereotype `$<<quantum\space circuit>>$`.
- The various *activity partitions* (graphically represented as horizontal swim lanes) can be defined in the parent activity by employing the `$<<qubit>>$` stereotype.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

- All the different quantum gates applied in the circuits are, therefore, represented as *action* elements and are placed in the respective swim lane.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

- Ordinary quantum gates (such as H, Y, Z, etc.) are 
  represented as *call operation actions* plus the `$<<quantum\space gate>>$` stereotype.
- Conditional gates are represented with multiple action elements.
  - The control qubits are represented with *send signal action* elements with the stereotype `$<<controlled\space qubit>>$`
  - The gate applied is represented with the counterpart element, *accept event action*, plus the `$<<quantum\space gate>>$` stereotype.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

- Special operations, such as qubit measuring and qubit resetting, are represented with *value specification action* elements and their respective stereotypes 
  `$<<measure>>$` and `$<<reset>>$`.

#### 3.1 Running Example

The paper provides a running example by using the teleportation algorithm.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

- The whole circuit is enclosed in a composed *activity* with the respective stereotype.
- This circuit, therefore, has three horizontal activity partitions (one for each qubit).
- The quantum gates and measures are then placed as action elements in the same position as in the original quantum circuit.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

- With regard to the quantum gates CNOT and CZ, these are modelled with pairs of *send signal action* and *accept event action* connected by a restriction edge.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

One interesting aspect of the quantum circuit represented 
with UML

- Measures can be connected with data store nodes that represent classical values after a qubit is measured. <p class = "note">(msg1 and register1)</p>

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

If attention is paid to the equivalent QASM source code of the teleportation algorithm (see Figure 5), it will be noted that the explicit control flow modelled with the Quantum UML Profile is almost the same as that defined using the source code.

### 4. Discussion

This paper introduces the idea of modelling quantum circuits in UML Activity Diagrams.

The approach followed in this research consists of a lightweight extension based on a UML profile.

UML Profile has two clear advantages:

1. The reuse of existing UML modelling tools.
2. integration with other standard UML elements, which is useful as regards representing hybrid information systems.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

The main implication of this work is that quantum circuits 
can be designed and modelled in the UML.

- The existing UML-based code generators couldbe extended in order to automatically generate quantum source code, such as QASM, Q#, or Qiskit.
- These UML representations may be key aspects during the software modernisation processes employed to migrate classical and quantum software towards hybrid information systems.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

#### Future work

The Quantum UML Profile will cover other viewpoints and aspects of the analysis and design of hybrid information systems.

For example, use case, class, sequence, component and deployment diagrams will be extended with the Quantum UML Profile.</script></section></div>
